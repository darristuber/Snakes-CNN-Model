# Snakes-CNN-Model
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model tailored to distinguish between seven prevalent snake species in Tampa, Florida. These seven species comprise five relatively non-threatening snakes. The significance of our model lies in its ability to differentiate visually similar snakes that significantly vary in their potential danger to humans. 
The fear of snakes is notably one of the most widespread phobias among individuals. While rooted in primal instincts, this fear is further amplified by contemporary cultural beliefs and superstitions. Florida is home to approximately fifty distinct snake species, with six of them presenting venomous threats to humans. In response to this concern, we have developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model tailored to distinguish between seven prevalent snake species in Tampa, Florida. These seven species comprise five relatively non-threatening snakes—North American Racer, Ringneck snake, Eastern Rat Snake, Banded Water Snake, and Eastern Hognose Snake—and two hazardous pit-vipers, namely the Cottonmouth and Diamondback Rattlesnake. The significance of our model lies in its ability to differentiate visually similar snakes that significantly vary in their potential danger to humans. For example, discerning between the Diamondback Rattlesnake and Eastern Hognose Snake, or the Cottonmouth and Banded Water Snake, can pose a challenge to the untrained eye. Our CNN model holds particular promise as the initial component of a snake identification application, assisting individuals in recognizing encountered snakes and providing them with vital safety information.
